A decentralised Streaming portal that has been tweaked and personalised with the assistance of a Moralis tutorial. 

This build taught me how to use IPFS( a decentralised storage platform) that can be utilised to store and retrieve information. I uploaded the Album files to IPFS and then used a Moralis API to retrieve the metadata I specified in the metadata.js file. This included information such as image, name, artist and animation url. 

In addition, I learnt how to use frameworks such as Anchor to build a visually appealing front-end. This skill is useful in the web3 space as the UI is the bridge that connects users to the back-end infrastructure of the blockchain. In addition, I explored tools like ant.design which hosts a plethora of modern templates for CSS styling. 

I learnt how to use the Polygon Mumbai testnet in order to deploy my Album.sol smart contract. This process involved me using an ERC721 contract from OpenZepllin and compiling it using Remix IDE. This contract was used to mint the album NFTs onto OpenSea marketplace, once these contracts were minted I used the Moralis API to connect the NFT metadata to my front-end React application.
